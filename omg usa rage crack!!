--usa-rage crack???
--this kick script was actually made long for fun
--imagine using this really simple script, if you actually want just use this = game.Players.LocalPlayer:Kick("your message")

local game = game
local players = game.Players
local localplayer = players.LocalPlayer
local mes = "yeah i didnt even make script fully"

localplayer:Kick("" .. mes .. "")
print("the message was " .. mes .. " actually")
